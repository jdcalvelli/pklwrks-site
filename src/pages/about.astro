		<h3>what?</h3>
		<p>
			as a consultancy, pklwrks LLC works with select clients as both in thought partnership and consultant engineering
			primarily in the areas of digital game design and development, interactive exhibition design and development,
			and full stack web design and development. pklwrks LLC uses the revenue from its consulting work as a
			catalyst for the development of experimental games and the support of the independent game community.

			as a studio, pklwrks LLC develops digital games and interactive experiences that focus on experimental mechanics,
			compelling narratives and accessibility of play, with an eye towards games as a medium of poetic expression and 
			as a vector for learning and the broadening of perspectives. games by pklwrks LLC hope to make you think 
			about the world just a little bit differently, to maybe learn something that you otherwise didn't know
			about yourself or others.
